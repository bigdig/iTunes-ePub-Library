iTunes ePub Library
===================

This repository consists of three main components:

- A php script that searches for epub files and lists them in an xml file
- the resulting xml file, containing all book information + paths to book covers
- an xsl file that is used to transform the xml into a nice looking library html file


The html and css components for the final result have been copied from the Google Chrome Web Store. Because it's an adorable, easily maintainable layout.
